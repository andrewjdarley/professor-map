## Rate-My-Professor MyMAP insert

This project is all about improving the class registration process at BYU in which students frequently write various professor names in Rate My Professor to get an idea which sections are rated the best. It involves regularly scraping Rate My Professor and uploading the ratings and reviews to Supabase. It is presented as a Chrome Extension that integrates directly with MyMAP and displays information right next to the professor name and section times.
